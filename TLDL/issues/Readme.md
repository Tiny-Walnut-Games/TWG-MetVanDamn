This directory `TWG-MetVanDamn\TLDL\issues` (`TWG-MetVanDamn/` is the current root of the project that contains the Assets and Packages directories), is to be used for all issues created using the Scribe window.
With the exception of the root itself - as all projects have their own root which will always be different than mine, I do not recommend changing this directory, as it should be used by the Chronicler/CI flow for automating issue creation. Assignments still must be done manually, though you can try using @copilot in the issue. There's a chance they may start one for you.
