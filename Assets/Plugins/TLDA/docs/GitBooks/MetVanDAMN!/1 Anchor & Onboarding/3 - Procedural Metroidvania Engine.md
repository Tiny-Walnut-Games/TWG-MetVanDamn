# TLDL: MetVanDAMN ‚Äî Procedural Metroidvania Engine

## Purpose

This document serves as the **source of truth** for the MetVanDAMN engine project ‚Äî a procedural, polarity‚Äëaware Metroidvania world generator ‚Äî using **ECSDOTS** as the data backbone, **WFC** for topology and biome shaping, and **gated progression logic** as the genre‚Äôs DNA.  
It will be maintained as a living dev log with The Living Dev Agent (LDA) as our historian, ensuring every major decision, milestone, and unlock is preserved.

## How to Use This Document

### 1. **Anchor Context for AI Agents**
* Contains the overall project goal, world‚Äëgeneration grammar, and gating rules so resets or new collaborators can quickly orient.
* Documents current implementation status for each engine subsystem (topology, biome logic, progression orchestration).

### 2. **Track Development Progress**
* Completed features, current blockers, and upcoming tasks are listed under `Current Progress`.
* Engine runs, seed tests, and CI validation output are summarized and linked.

### 3. **Facilitate Debugging and Problem‚ÄëSolving**
* Notes on WFC rule conflicts, polarity seam mismatches, and unreachable node detection.
* References to specific ECSDOTS systems and biome socket rules in question.

### 4. **Enhance Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**
* Serves as a shared lore + tech archive for contributors.
* Preserves *genre recognizability* for external reviewers.

## Template Structure

### Project Overview

**Goal**:  
```
Build the procedural Metroidvania engine people recognize on sight ‚Äî ‚ÄúMetVanDAMN‚Äù ‚Äî complete with procedural map generation, biomes, polarity locks, one‚Äëway routes, and intentional backtracking rewards.
```

**Status**:  
```
Core ECSDOTS components stubbed.  
Polarity grammar draft in progress.  
Macro WFC tileset under design.
```

---

### Current Progress

#### Completed Components
```
- ECSDOTS base entity/component layout for NodeId, Biome, Connection, GateCondition.
- Bitmask polarity enum supporting dual‚Äëpolarity gates.
- Initial stub systems for DistrictWfcSystem, SectorRefineSystem.
```

#### Current Issues
```
1. **Polarity Socket Rule Conflicts**
   - Location: BiomeFieldSystem
   - Suspected Cause: Socket definitions allow invalid dual‚Äëpolarity adjacency.
   - Status: In progress ‚Äî adjusting adjacency constraints.
```

#### Next Steps
```
1. Finalize polarity grammar v1 with 6‚Äì8 poles and valid adjacency rules.
2. Author 12‚Äì20 macro district WFC tiles with socket metadata.
3. Integrate reachability + loop density validation into CI scroll system.

### Key Learnings
```
- Polarity masks simplify dual‚Äëgate logic compared to discrete enums.
- Early validation prevents WFC collapse dead‚Äëends.
```

### Debug Information

#### Current Issues Details
```
Problem: Adjacent biomes generating invalid polarity junctions.
Location: BiomeFieldSystem
Suspected Cause: Socket metadata incomplete for dual polarity support.
Status: In progress
```

#### Debug Focus Areas
```
- Verify socket metadata for each macro tile.
- Test dual polarity adjacency in WFC test harness.
```
