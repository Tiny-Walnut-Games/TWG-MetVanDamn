### 🎯 **Search Patterns & Intent Categories**

#### **Intent Markers Found:**
- `⚠ Intention ⚠` - Documented design decisions
- `⚠ Methodology ⚠` - Process explanations  
- `⚠ Fix/Upgrade ⚠` - Applied improvements
- `⚠ nitpick ⚠` - Small refinements
- `@jmeyer1980:` - Personal notes and reasoning
- `@Copilot TODO` - Collaborative validation points

#### **Common Nitpick Categories:**
1. **Performance Optimizations** (SetLocalPositionAndRotation patterns)
2. **Modern C# Idioms** (switch expressions, range operators, tuple deconstruction)
3. **Code Clarity** (explicit namespacing, variable naming)
4. **Architecture Decisions** (modular vs monolithic, widget patterns)
5. **Validation Checkpoints** (autocomplete verification, field validation)

## 🚫 **Option 2: Automated Nitpick Mining Operation** (QUARANTINED)

<!--
⚠ INTENT QUARANTINE ⚠
Reasoning: Automated mining could overwhelm with false positives and miss context-sensitive improvements.
The archaeological dig approach provides better signal-to-noise ratio and preserves developer intent.

This approach would involve:
- Automated regex scanning for pattern markers
- AST analysis for code improvement opportunities  
- Bulk collection without human context filtering
- Risk of generating noise rather than actionable insights

Keeping this option commented for potential future use when codebase stabilizes
and we need comprehensive coverage over surgical precision.
