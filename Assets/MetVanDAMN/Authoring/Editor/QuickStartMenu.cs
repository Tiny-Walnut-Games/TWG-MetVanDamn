        // The demo scenes I require would be 100% functional, fully set up with 100% configured subscenes with appropriate game objects and authoring required for that subscene. It requires player controls, fully functioning cinemachine room zones, masking that hide everything but the current room, all required Cinemachine cameras, lighting, post-processing, physics, and sample art assets to demonstrate MetVanDAMN capabilities in each style (2D platformer, top-down, 3D). They would be polished and ready for users to explore and modify as starting points for their own projects. 100% true "click menu, click play, profit." Unity's 2D scenes are all set with a specific scene view but everything in this kit creates a standard 3D scene view. This is lazy and unacceptable. Fix it. All 2D scenes should default to a 2D scene view with the 2D camera and standard 2D tilemap layout. I personally do not like 2D top-own games being created in a 3D scene.Nothing 2D-scene related should be on the default 3D plane.
