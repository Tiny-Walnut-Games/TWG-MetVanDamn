## üéØ Purpose

Integrate and verify **MetVanDAMN Core world‚Äëgen components** ‚Äî focusing on Biome, Polarity, Connection, and District WFC ‚Äî ensuring they compile and run cleanly in Unity DOTS after repo clone. Remove blocking errors from previous commits and align with **Living Dev Agent** documentation rituals for reproducibility.

---

## üóì Timeline & Context

- **When:** 2025‚Äë08‚Äë20 ‚Äî initial integration + workflow run.
- **Why:** TLDA needed fully functional ECS systems for procedural Metroidvania worldgen before higher‚Äëlevel progression & polarity validation.
- **How:** Implemented clean ECS component definitions + stub/in‚Äëprogress systems. Cleared Unity compile errors by resolving namespace, syntax, and dependency issues in generated scripts.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

```
Biome.cs
 - Added Polarity enum (bitmask) for single & dual polarity gates.
 - Added BiomeType enum for all core biome categories.
 - Implemented Biome IComponentData struct with polarity fields, difficulty modifier, helper methods.

BiomeFieldData.cs
 - Simple IComponentData for seeding world polarity/biome gradients.

BiomeFieldSystem.cs
 - OnCreate: Required lookups for Biome, NodeId, Connection buffers.
 - OnUpdate: Deterministic per-frame seed, random assignment, polarity strength calc, secondary polarity assignment, difficulty scaling.
 - Stubbed but functional Burst-compatible ECS system.

BiomeValidationSystem.cs
 - Occasional validation job to check polarity coherence, biome-type/polarity match, difficulty range sanity.

Connection.cs
 - ConnectionType enum for traversal modes (bidirectional, one-way, vent, teleporter, etc.).
 - Connection struct with traversal logic, polarity checks, pathfinding cost.
 - BufferElement wrapper for ECS buffers.

DistrictWfcSystem.cs
 - OnCreate: Lookup/buffer requirements for WFC generation.
 - OnUpdate: Per-frame deterministic random, scheduled DistrictWfcJob.
 - DistrictWfcJob stub: Handles Initialized/InProgress/Complete states (macro worldgen).
```

## üõ† Changes & Fixes (Unity Compile Recovery)

```
- Fixed namespace alignment for TinyWalnutGames.MetVD.Core across all core ECS scripts.
- Added required Unity.Entities / Unity.Mathematics using directives.
- Clamped float fields (e.g., PolarityStrength, DifficultyModifier) to valid ranges.
- Adjusted constructor defaults to prevent NaN/invalid component state.
- Removed or stubbed out unimplemented calls causing build breaks.
- Verified BurstCompile usage on partial structs for ECS jobs.
- Ensured all IComponentData, IBufferElementData, ISystem, IJobEntity signatures match Entities 1.0+ API.
```

## üìä Validation Run Summary (MetVanDamnLogs.txt)

**Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS GitHub Actions runner  
**Agent Prep:** Clean node v22.18.0 load, Copilot agent initialized.  
**MCP Servers:**  
- Blackbird MCP ‚Äî connected in 271‚ÄØms (no tools allowed).  
- GitHub MCP ‚Äî 38 tools retrieved.  
- Playwright MCP ‚Äî installed `@playwright/mcp@0.0.34` (~11‚ÄØs), 24 tools retrieved.

**Result:** No script compile errors post‚Äëintegration. All ECS systems present & recognized in Unity project after clone.

---

## üìå Known Issues / Next Pass

```
- BiomeFieldSystem: WorldPos uses NodeId.Coordinates ‚Äî ensure populated during graph gen.
- DistrictWfcJob: ProcessWfcStep logic incomplete ‚Äî needs adjacency/socket constraint resolution.
- No polarity audit enforcement yet in gate placement.
- No unit/integration tests committed for biome polarity adjacency.
```

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Implement `ProcessWfcStep` to collapse candidate tiles respecting polarity sockets.
2. Connect NodeId.Coordinates assignment in graph gen stage.
3. Add GatePlacementSystem pass w/ polarity & ability pacing.
4. Write unit tests for BiomeField/Validation polarity rules.
5. Integrate CI badge output (Reachability, Loop Density) into LDA Chronicle Keeper.

## ü§ù AI Assistance

- **Context Recovery:** Used provided gists + logs to reconstruct complete ECS core state.
- **Error Resolution:** Identified & removed Unity compile blockers in generated scripts.
- **Formatting:** Delivered this log in LDL/TLDL quad‚Äëfenced markdown for direct repo insertion.

---

## üìú Lessons Learned

- Maintaining polarity as a bitmask keeps gate logic extensible and WFC-friendly.
- Early BurstCompile & RequireForUpdate calls reduce runtime surprises in ECS flows.
- CI log inspection after Unity compile is the fastest way to confirm a clean integration step before layering complexity.

---

**Milestone Goal:** Core ECS data + systems present, compiling, and ready for functional WFC & gating logic.  
**Success Criteria:** No compile errors in Unity after fresh clone; ECS systems recognized; logs show clean agent/tool handshake.
