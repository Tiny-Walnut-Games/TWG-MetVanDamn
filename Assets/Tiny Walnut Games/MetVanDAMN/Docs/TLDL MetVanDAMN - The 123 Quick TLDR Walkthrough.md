## **0Ô∏è‚É£ Before You Begin ‚Äî Clear the Stage**
- Install **Unity 6+ / Entities 1.0+** with DOTS packages ready.
- Clone the repo (template‚Äëderived) into your local workspace.
- Ensure `.NET SDK` and **Burst compiler** are installed.
- Verify you can open the project without compile errors.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ One World Seed**
- Create a **WorldConfiguration** entity with:
  - `WorldSeed` set to a fixed test value.
  - `WorldBounds` sized for your target grid.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Two Core Assemblies**
- `MetVanDAMN.Core` ‚Äî ECS components (Biome, Connection, GateCondition, etc.).
- `MetVanDAMN.Generation` ‚Äî WFC + sector refinement systems.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Three Crucial Systems**
- `DistrictWfcSystem`
- `SectorRefineSystem`
- `BiomeFieldSystem`  
Place them in `SimulationSystemGroup` so they tick automatically.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Four Polarity Fields**
- Sun, Moon, Heat, Cold ‚Äî seeded in `BiomeFieldEntities`.
- Give each a center position and radius.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Five Test Seeds**
- Save at least five reproducible seeds to `/docs/seed_snapshots`.
- Use them for regression tests and CI comparisons.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Six Gate Types**
- Hard, Soft, Dual‚Äëpolarity, One‚Äëway, Drop, Vent (expand as needed).

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Seven Loop Density Targets**
- Tune `SectorRefinementData.TargetLoopDensity` for pacing.
- Start around 0.3, adjust to hit 7+ satisfying backtracks per full run.

---

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ Eight Validation Checks**
- Reachability, Loop count, Biome/polarity audit, Gate pacing, Difficulty curve, Orphan check, Contradiction check, Seed replay match.

---

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Nine CI Steps**
1. Checkout  
2. Cache restore  
3. Build  
4. Unit tests  
5. Integration seed replays  
6. Badge generation  
7. Chronicle Keeper scroll generation (manual until TLDA fixed)  
8. Artifact upload  
9. README badge update

---

## **üîü Ten Lore Hooks**
- Add narrative snippets to TLDLs for each major system.
- Chronicle Keeper picks them up once TLDA integration is restored.
