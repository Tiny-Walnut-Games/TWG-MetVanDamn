# ðŸš€ CI/CD Test Change for Pipeline Validation

This file was created to test the complete CI pipeline as part of Phase 1 completion 
of the CID Schoolhouse CI/CD Optimization Roadmap.

## Test Goals

- Verify Guarded Pass wrapper functionality
- Test security workflow path filters
- Validate CI performance monitoring
- Confirm all Phase 1 optimizations are working

## Expected Behaviors

âœ… **CI Workflow should:**
- Use path filters to only run relevant jobs
- Apply concurrency controls
- Use caching for dependencies
- Complete structure preflight checks
- Transform expected validation "failures" into Guarded Pass signals

âœ… **Security Workflow should:**
- Apply new path filters for efficient scanning
- Skip unnecessary scans on unrelated changes
- Continue advisory scans without blocking
