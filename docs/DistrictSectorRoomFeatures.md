# District, Sector, and Room Features Implementation

This document describes the newly implemented features that address the previously unused parameters in the MetVanDAMN world generation system.

## Overview

The following missing features have been implemented to make full use of the `WorldConfiguration` parameters:

1. **TargetSectors Parameter Usage** - Now properly controls district and sector generation
2. **Complete Sector/Room Hierarchy** - Fixed compilation errors and completed the system
3. **Room Management System** - Added comprehensive room state, navigation, and feature systems
4. **Hierarchical Node ID System** - Proper unique ID generation for districts, sectors, and rooms

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. TargetSectors Parameter Integration

**Previously:** The `TargetSectors` parameter in `WorldConfiguration` was completely unused.

**Now:** 
- `DistrictLayoutSystem` respects the `TargetSectors` parameter to limit district placement
- Distributes sectors across districts based on the target count
- Properly calculates sectors per district when `TargetSectors` is specified

```csharp
// New logic in DistrictLayoutSystem
var targetDistrictCount = worldConfig.TargetSectors > 0 ? 
    math.min(worldConfig.TargetSectors, unplacedCount) : unplacedCount;

// Add SectorHierarchyData to each placed district
var sectorData = new SectorHierarchyData(
    new int2(6, 6), // Local grid size for sectors
    math.max(1, worldConfig.TargetSectors / targetDistrictCount), // Sectors per district
    random.NextUInt()
);
```

### 2. Fixed SectorRoomHierarchySystem

**Previously:** The system had compilation errors due to missing constants.

**Now:**
- Added `HierarchyConstants` class with proper ID multipliers
- Fixed all compilation errors
- System now properly creates sectors and rooms within districts

```csharp
public static class HierarchyConstants
{
    public const uint SectorIdMultiplier = 1000;
    public const uint RoomsPerSectorMultiplier = 100;
}
```

### 3. Complete Room Management System

**New:** Added comprehensive `RoomManagementSystem` with:

#### Room State Tracking
```csharp
public struct RoomStateData : IComponentData
{
    public bool IsVisited;
    public bool IsExplored;
    public int SecretsFound;
    public int TotalSecrets;
    public float CompletionPercentage;
}
```

#### Room Navigation Data
```csharp
public struct RoomNavigationData : IComponentData
{
    public int EntranceCount;
    public int2 PrimaryEntrance;
    public bool IsCriticalPath;
    public float TraversalTime;
}
```

#### Room Features System
```csharp
public struct RoomFeatureElement : IBufferElementData
{
    public RoomFeatureType Type;
    public int2 Position;
    public uint FeatureId;
}

public enum RoomFeatureType : byte
{
    Enemy, PowerUp, HealthPickup, SaveStation, 
    Obstacle, Platform, Switch, Door, Secret, Collectible
}
```

### 4. Room Types and Specialization

The system now supports different room types with specialized content:

- **Boss Rooms:** Central boss spawn, combat platforms
- **Treasure Rooms:** Power-ups and collectibles
- **Save Rooms:** Save stations for player progress
- **Shop Rooms:** Item purchase locations
- **Normal Rooms:** Enemies, obstacles, occasional secrets

### 5. Hierarchical System Integration

The systems now work together in proper order:

```
DistrictLayoutSystem (uses TargetSectors)
    ↓
SectorRoomHierarchySystem (creates sectors and rooms)
    ↓
RoomManagementSystem (populates rooms with features)
    ↓
SectorRefineSystem (adds loops and locks)
```

## Benefits

### For Developers
- All `WorldConfiguration` parameters now have meaningful effects
- Complete hierarchical world structure from districts down to room features
- Extensible room feature system for adding new content types
- Proper separation of concerns between systems

### For Gameplay
- Rooms now have state tracking for exploration completion
- Different room types provide varied gameplay experiences
- Navigation data supports AI pathfinding
- Critical path identification for progression tracking

### For World Generation
- Deterministic room placement and feature generation
- Configurable world size through `TargetSectors`
- Balanced distribution of special rooms (boss, treasure, save)
- Proper scaling of content based on room size

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been added in `DistrictSectorRoomFeaturesTests.cs` to validate:

- TargetSectors parameter usage
- Sector hierarchy data structures
- Room type functionality
- Feature system operation
- Hierarchical ID generation

## Usage Example

```csharp
var worldConfig = new WorldConfiguration
{
    Seed = 12345,
    WorldSize = new int2(100, 100),
    TargetSectors = 8,  // Now actually used!
    RandomizationMode = RandomizationMode.Partial
};

// This will create:
// - Up to 8 districts (limited by TargetSectors)
// - Sectors within each district (distributed based on TargetSectors)
// - Rooms within each sector with appropriate features
// - Proper hierarchical relationships and unique IDs
```

## Future Extensions

The new system provides a foundation for additional features:

- Room connection pathfinding
- Dynamic room modification during gameplay
- Procedural room content generation
- Player progression tracking per room
- Achievement systems based on exploration completion

## Performance Considerations

- All systems are Burst-compiled for optimal performance
- Hierarchical IDs allow efficient parent-child lookups
- Buffer systems minimize memory allocations
- Systems process entities in parallel where possible

This implementation transforms the previously unused parameters into a fully functional hierarchical world generation system, providing the foundation for rich Metroidvania gameplay experiences.
