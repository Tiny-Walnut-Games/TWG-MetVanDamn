3. **[Secret Room Logic Expansion](secret-room-logic-expansion.md)**
   - **Status**: Plan in development  
   - **Timeline**: 4 weeks estimated
   - **Dependencies**: SecretAreaConfig, ProceduralRoomGeneration.cs
   - **Impact**: Core genre expectation for hidden content

### Medium Priority (Next Phase)
4. **[Environmental Hazards & Traps System](environmental-hazards-traps-system.md)**
   - **Status**: Architecture design needed
   - **Timeline**: 6 weeks estimated
   - **Dependencies**: BiomeArtProfile, new system development
   - **Impact**: Biome identity and challenge variation

5. **[Dynamic Events System](dynamic-events-system.md)**
   - **Status**: Architecture design needed
   - **Timeline**: 8 weeks estimated
   - **Dependencies**: RoomManagementSystem.cs, new event framework
   - **Impact**: Replay value and emergent gameplay

6. **[Boss Integration Enhancement](boss-integration-enhancement.md)**
   - **Status**: Plan in development
   - **Timeline**: 3 weeks estimated
   - **Dependencies**: RoomManagementSystem.cs (extend existing)
   - **Impact**: Biome-specific encounters and variety

### Lower Priority (Future Phases)
7. **[Traversal Upgrades Integration](traversal-upgrades-integration.md)**
   - **Status**: Architecture design needed
   - **Timeline**: 4 weeks estimated
   - **Dependencies**: Connection system, progression integration
   - **Impact**: Future-proofing for ability upgrades

8. **[Environmental Storytelling System](environmental-storytelling-system.md)**
   - **Status**: Architecture design needed
   - **Timeline**: 6 weeks estimated
   - **Dependencies**: BiomeArtIntegrationSystem.cs, new lore framework
   - **Impact**: Narrative depth and world coherence

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprints 1-3)
Focus on systems that enhance existing functionality:
- Jump/Landing Zone Traversal (extends navigation)
- Meta-Progression Hooks (extends gate conditions)
- Secret Room Logic (extends procedural generation)

### Phase 2: New Systems (Sprints 4-6) 
Introduce completely new feature systems:
- Environmental Hazards & Traps
- Dynamic Events System
- Enhanced Boss Integration

### Phase 3: Polish & Integration (Sprints 7-8)
Complete the ecosystem with advanced features:
- Traversal Upgrades Integration
- Environmental Storytelling System
- Cross-system optimization and polish

## Success Metrics

### Genre Compliance Checklist
- [ ] **Procedural Variety**: Each run feels meaningfully different
- [ ] **Strong Biome Identity**: Visual, mechanical, and narrative distinctiveness
- [ ] **Traversal Variety**: Multiple movement options and skill expression
- [ ] **Secrets & Discovery**: Hidden content rewards exploration
- [ ] **Progression Hooks**: Clear advancement and unlocks
- [ ] **Dynamic Encounters**: Varied enemy/challenge placement
- [ ] **Replay Incentives**: Meta-progression and achievement systems

### Technical Validation
