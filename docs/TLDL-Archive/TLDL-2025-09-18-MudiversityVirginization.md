**Entry ID:** TLDL-2025-09-18-MudiversityVirginization  
**Author:** Living Dev Agent  
**Context:** Repository cleanup and customization for Mudiversity AI game project  
**Summary:** Purged MetVanDamn Unity artifacts and customized Living Dev Agent template for AI-powered multiverse adventure game

---

## üéØ Objective

Cleanse the Mudiversity repository of MetVanDamn Unity-specific artifacts and customize the Living Dev Agent template to focus on Python AI integration and multiverse storytelling rather than Unity game development.

## üîç Discovery

The repository contained extensive Unity development artifacts (.csproj files, .meta files, ProjectSettings, Packages) that were irrelevant to Mudiversity's Python/AI focus. Configuration files still referenced MetVanDamn projects, and several GitHub workflows were project-specific rather than generic Living Dev Agent workflows.

## ‚ö° Actions Taken

### Unity Artifact Removal

- Removed all Unity .csproj files (Assembly-CSharp*.csproj, Unity.*.csproj, etc.)
- Purged Unity .meta files from Assets/ directory
- Deleted ProjectSettings/ and Packages/ directories
- Removed Temp/ and obj/ build directories

### Configuration Customization

- Updated TWG-Copilot-Agent.yaml project information for Mudiversity
- Replaced MetVanDamn references with Mudiversity AI storytelling focus
- Updated devtimetravel_snapshot.yaml to reflect Mudiversity development workflows

### Workflow Cleanup

- Removed alchemist-* workflows (determinism CI, manifest automation)
- Removed warbler-validate.yml workflow
- Removed MetVanDamn-specific ci.yml
- Removed CID faculty/schoolhouse and shield-demo workflows

### Documentation Updates

- Created this TLDL entry documenting the virginization process
- Maintained core Living Dev Agent functionality while removing project-specific content

## üß† Key Insights

### Technical Learnings

- Living Dev Agent template is highly modular and can be adapted for different project types
- Unity artifacts can be safely removed when transitioning to Python/AI focus
- Configuration files need project-specific customization beyond template placeholders

### Process Improvements

- Virginization process should be documented for future template users
- Validation tools remain functional after artifact removal
- GitHub workflows can be selectively kept based on relevance to project type

## üöß Challenges Encountered

- Identifying which workflows were generic vs project-specific required careful review
- Ensuring validation tools still functioned after Unity artifact removal
- Maintaining Living Dev Agent core functionality while customizing for Mudiversity

## üìã Next Steps

- [x] Run validation suite to confirm repo integrity
- [ ] Test Living Dev Agent initialization workflow
- [ ] Verify TLDL system functionality
- [ ] Consider creating Mudiversity-specific CI workflow
