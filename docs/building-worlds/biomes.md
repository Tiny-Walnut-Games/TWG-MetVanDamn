- **Heat Biome**: Volcanic, dangerous, fiery intensity
- **Cold Biome**: Icy, frozen, chilling stillness

### **Why Biomes Matter**
- **Immersion**: Makes world feel real and lived-in
- **Gameplay**: Environmental challenges and opportunities
- **Progression**: Areas that require specific abilities
- **Atmosphere**: Emotional tone and storytelling

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Biome Field Configuration**
In MetVanDAMN, biomes create fields with:

**Field Strength**: How strongly the biome affects the area
**Transition Radius**: How gradually effects change
**Polarity Balance**: Mix of different biome influences

### **Debug Visualization**
See biome effects in action:
- Press **M** for world map
- Look for colored overlays showing biome fields
- Check console for polarity field generation messages

### **Performance Considerations**
- More biomes = more complex calculations
- Balance detail with performance
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) for distant areas

---

## üéØ **Biome Design Best Practices**

### **Start Simple**
1. Choose 2-3 biomes for your first world
2. Focus on clear visual differences
3. Add basic gameplay effects
4. Test player feedback

### **Balance is Key**
- No biome should feel "bad" to visit
- Each biome should offer unique advantages
- Players should want to explore all areas
- Abilities should feel useful everywhere

### **Storytelling Through Environment**
- Use biomes to tell your world's story
- Environmental changes can show progression
- Biome conflicts can create narrative tension
- Player abilities can alter biome behavior
