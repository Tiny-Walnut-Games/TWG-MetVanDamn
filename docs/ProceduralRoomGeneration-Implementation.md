# Procedural Room Generation Master Spec - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive procedural room generation system for MetVanDAMN following the Master Spec outlined in Issue #35. The system implements the complete pipeline flow with ECS-driven architecture for performance and maintainability.

## Architecture Components

### Core Data Structures (`ProceduralRoomGeneration.cs`)
- **RoomGeneratorType**: Enum mapping to Best Fit Matrix requirements
- **MovementCapabilityTags**: Skill-aware tagging system using existing Ability flags
- **RoomTemplate**: Template data linking generator types to movement requirements
- **JumpArcPhysics**: Physics parameters for reachability validation
- **RoomNavigationElement**: Buffer for movement-type-aware navigation connections

### Pipeline Systems

#### 1. ProceduralRoomGeneratorSystem (`ProceduralRoomGeneratorSystem.cs`)
**Phase 1-4 of Master Spec Pipeline**
- Biome Selection: Spatial coordinate-based biome determination
- Layout Type: Vertical vs horizontal based on room bounds and biome constraints
- Room Generator Choice: Algorithm selection based on room type and biome
- Content Pass: Template creation with skill requirements and secret area allocation

**Generator Type Mapping to Best Fit Matrix:**
- `PatternDrivenModular` ‚Üí Movement skill puzzles (dash, wall-cling, grapple)
- `ParametricChallenge` ‚Üí Platforming testing grounds with jump arc solver
- `WeightedTilePrefab` ‚Üí Standard platforming with optional secrets
- `VerticalSegment` ‚Üí Vertical layout rooms (towers, shafts)
- `HorizontalCorridor` ‚Üí Horizontal layout rooms (flow platforming)
- `SkyBiomePlatform` ‚Üí Sky biome with moving platforms

#### 2. RoomNavigationGeneratorSystem (`RoomNavigationGeneratorSystem.cs`)
**Phase 6: Navigation Generation (Post-Content)**
- **Empty-Above-Traversable Rule**: Marks empty tiles above walkable surfaces as navigable
- **Jump Vector Calculation**: Computes reachable positions based on movement capabilities
- **Movement-Type Tags**: Adds ability requirements (Jump, Dash, WallJump) to nav edges
- **Secret Route Integration**: Creates alternate paths requiring optional skills

#### 3. CinemachineZoneGeneratorSystem (`CinemachineZoneGeneratorSystem.cs`)
**Phase 7: Cinemachine Zone Generation**
- **Biome-Specific Camera Presets**: 
  - Sky biome: Wide FOV (75¬∞) for expansive aerial views
  - Underground: Tight framing (45¬∞) for cave environments
  - Mountain: Medium-wide (65¬∞) for vertical spaces
- **Room-Type Camera Priorities**: Boss rooms (15), Treasure (12), Hub (10), Normal (5)
- **Dynamic Blend Times**: Quick transitions (0.3s) for boss, smooth (1.0s) for hubs
- **Confiner Volume Generation**: Camera bounds from room bounds with padding

### Physics & Validation (`JumpArcSolver.cs`)
**Reachability Validation System**
- **Ballistic Trajectory Calculation**: Physics-aware jump arc validation
- **Multi-Movement Support**: Jump, DoubleJump, Dash, WallJump, Grapple
- **Breadth-First Reachability**: Generates all reachable positions from entrance
- **Room Completability Validation**: Ensures critical positions are accessible

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Building on Existing Infrastructure
- **Extends RoomManagementSystem**: Builds on existing room feature and state tracking
- **Uses Existing Ability System**: Leverages `GateCondition` and `Ability` enums for consistency
- **Integrates with Biome Art**: Works with existing `BiomeArtIntegrationSystem`
- **Maintains ECS Patterns**: All systems use Burst compilation and proper ECS data flow
