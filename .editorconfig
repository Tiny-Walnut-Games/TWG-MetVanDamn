# ==================================================
# 🧙‍♂️ TACTICAL SYMBOL ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL
# "Force AI assistants to see real problems, protect meaningful symbols"
# "Perfect is the enemy of good - aim for >95% symbol preservation"
# ==================================================

# UNRESOLVED SYMBOLS - These are REAL ERRORS that AI must fix (your forcing function!)
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0103.severity = error  # Name does not exist in current context - MUST FIX
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0246.severity = error  # Type or namespace not found - MUST FIX  
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0234.severity = error  # Type/namespace does not exist in namespace - MUST FIX
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0117.severity = error  # Does not contain definition - MUST FIX
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0104.severity = error  # Ambiguous reference - MUST FIX
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0119.severity = error  # Expression denotes a type but is used as variable - MUST FIX

# DECLARED BUT NEVER USED - These are REAL PROBLEMS that need purpose or fixing
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0219.severity = error  # Variable assigned but never used - FIND PURPOSE OR FIX
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0168.severity = error  # Variable declared but never used - FIND PURPOSE OR FIX  
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0414.severity = error  # Field assigned but never used - FIND PURPOSE OR FIX
dotnet_diagnostic.CS0169.severity = error  # Field never used - FIND PURPOSE OR FIX

# SACRED SYMBOL PRESERVATION - These are ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES, not deletions
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0059.severity = suggestion # "Unnecessary" assignment - MAKE IT COORDINATE-AWARE
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0060.severity = suggestion # "Unused" parameter - ADD SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE  
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0051.severity = suggestion # "Private member never used" - FIND CREATIVE PURPOSE
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0052.severity = suggestion # "Private member can be removed" - TRANSFORM TO DEBUG AID

# STYLE AND OPTIMIZATION - Suggestions for improvement, not deletion mandates  
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1822.severity = suggestion  # Member can be static - BUT CONSIDER NODEIDS FIRST
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1823.severity = suggestion  # Unused private fields - MAKE THEM COORDINATE-AWARE
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1801.severity = suggestion  # Unused parameters - USE FOR DEBUGGING/LOGGING

# ==================================================
# 🎯 THE TACTICAL DIFFERENCE:
# CS#### errors = "This code won't compile or has undefined references" → ERROR (forces AI attention)
# IDE#### warnings = "This could be optimized or simplified" → SUGGESTION (preserve and enhance)
# Like GPU mesh generation: >95% success rate across all systems is engineering excellence!
# ==================================================

# Performance guidelines (not deletion mandates)

# ==================================================
# 🧮 SACRED ENHANCEMENT EXAMPLES
# 
# WHEN YOU SEE CS0103 (Name does not exist): This is a REAL ERROR - fix the reference!
# WHEN YOU SEE IDE0059 (Unnecessary assignment): This is an ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY - make it coordinate-aware!
#
# The difference: CS errors break compilation, IDE suggestions improve code quality
# Just like GPU mesh data: we aim for >95% preservation success across all AI systems
